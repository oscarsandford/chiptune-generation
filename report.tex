\section{Introduction}
Music is typically constructed by humans, for humans. However, machines are becoming more adept at revealing patterns in the way musicians craft their chords. 
This enables humans to create their own music, and then let the machine take over the task of composer. Our project aims to understand and implement a framework 
for simple music generation through temporal inference techniques. In this paper, we explore previous implementations and existing literature regarding music 
generation, and present techniques for designing generative Markov models to create derivative musical works.
